title: Statement of Purpose

Before making this website, I felt obliged to consider its utility. There are millions of blogs dedicated to sundry subjects; many of them are written by subject matter experts who know more about their respective fields than I could ever hope to learn. Further, even if I did have unique knowledge to offer others, I have no desire to market my blog. It thus seems unlikely that more than a few dozen people will ever read it, and I imagine that most of them will be family and close friends.

Perhaps this explains my prior reluctance to make a personal website. My time is finite and to spend it on this endeavor seemed wasteful.

But now, years after I first considered making a personal website, I think my hesitance rested on a faulty assumption. To measure the utility of a personal website solely by the value it delivers to others is short-sighted. Instead, I can view it as an investment into myself. There are the obvious learning opportunities - I am a professional software engineer, but I work exclusively on backend systems at my job, so this site offers a rare opportunity to try developing for the web. There are the obvious career considerations - a personal website is an engineering artifact that I can present to others as proof of competence, and I can also host a literal resume on it.

But to me, this site's _raison d'Ãªtre_ is to serve as a chronicle of the things I do, learn, and see. I cannot remember everything, or even most things, and to consciously preserve the things I deem important for my future self seems a worthwhile goal.

With this site I will go where many have gone before. But that's okay. This is for me.
