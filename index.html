        <p>Going forward, I expect that math will be a subject I discuss on this blog. Before discussing it, though, I needed to learn how to display math formulas in the browser. Based on my research, there are a few approaches one can take:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Render your formluas in TeX (or similar) and display them as images.</li>
          <li>Use a JavaScript library like <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render TeX equations (or similar) as SVG images, HTML+CSS, and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">MathML</a>, an ISO-standard XML schema for math equations, in the client's browser.</li>
          <li>Do something dumb like hand-write your equations in MathML, breaking your website's cross-browser compatibility in the process because, despite the fact that the HTML5 standard has included MathML <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">since <time datetime="2015">2015</time></a>, Chrome and its variants (Edge, Safari, Brave, etc.) still do not support it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Naturally I settled on the third option because, before today, I had never heard of MathML and I was curious. To learn the basics, I decided to transcribe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality</a> because it appears in the first few pages of my copy of <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/292079.Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis">Principles of Mathematical Analysis</a></i> and I lacked the motivation to look any further.</p>
        <p>Note that, as of <time datetime="2019-11-17">November 17th, 2019</time>, Firefox is the only browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/math#Browser_compatibility">that fully supports MathML</a>. If your browser does not correctly render what follows, <a href="images/cauchy-schwarz-inequality.png">here</a> is an image of the equations as rendered by Firefox.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to see the 83 lines of markup (I'm as horrified as you) that produced this equation, search for the string "cauchy-schwarz-inequality" in the page source, which you can view in the browser or on <a href="https://www.github.com/kmcconnaughay/kmcconnaughay.github.io">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are some takeaways from this exercise:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Character_entity_references_in_HTML">HTML named entities</a> allow you to insert otherwise difficult-to-type symbols into your markup. For example, "&sum;", the capital Greek letter sigma oft used in summations, is written <code class="inline-code">&amp;sum;</code> in HTML.</li>
          <li>For Unicode symbols that lack a named HTML entity, you can use their Unicode encoding directly. For example, "&#x2102;<!--DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C-->", the symbol commonly used to represent the set of complex numbers, is written <code class="inline-code">&amp;#x2102;</code> in HTML.</li>
          <li>MathML is verbose, but powerful. It comes with its own set of dedicated XML tags, like <code class="inline-code">&lt;mfrac&gt;</code> for fractions and <code class="inline-code">&lt;msup&gt;</code> for superscript, that allow you to construct arbitrarily complex equations. I appreciate that Firefox does this in vanilla HTML without the need for heavy JavaScript polyfills.</li>
          <li>Because MathML is verbose, writing it by hand is error-prone. I did my best write it semantically, but it's <s>possible</s> probable that I missed an <code class="inline-code">&lt;mrow&gt;</code> tag or made other, less obvious errors. In the future I might use a TeX to MathML converter to generate the markup, instead.</li>
          <li>I need to find a good HTML formatter and a static page templater to make writing new posts easier. I'm not going to use a managed solution like WordPress because half the point of this website is to learn new things from first principles, but I think some minimal tooling will make my life easier.</li>

          <p>Before making this website, I felt obliged to consider its utility. There are millions of blogs dedicated to sundry subjects; many of them are written by subject matter experts who know more about their respective fields than I could ever hope to learn. Further, even if I did have unique knowledge to offer others, I have no desire to market my blog. It thus seems unlikely that more than a few dozen people will ever read it, and I imagine that most of them will be family and close friends.</p>
          <p>Perhaps this explains my prior reluctance to make a personal website. My time is finite and to spend it on this endeavor seemed wasteful.</p>
          <p>And yet.</p>
          <p>Now, years after I first considered making a personal website, I think my hesitance rested on a faulty assumption. To measure the utility of a personal website solely by the value it delivers to others is short-sighted. Instead, I can view it as an investment into myself. There are the obvious learning opportunities - I am a professional software engineer, but I work exclusively on backend systems at my job, so this site offers a rare opportunity to try developing for the web. There are the obvious career considerations - a personal website is an engineering artifact that I can present to others as proof of competence, and I can also host a literal resume on it.</p>
          <p>But to me, this site's <i>raison d'être</i> is to serve as a chronicle of the things I do, learn, and see. I cannot remember everything, or even most things, and to consciously preserve the things I deem important for my future self seems a worthwhile goal.</p>
          <p>With this site I will go where many have gone before. But that's okay. This is for me.</p>
